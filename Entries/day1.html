<h1>Lonely?</h1>

    <p>Whenever I'm on my own or haven’t talked to a friend in a while, I start feeling unmotivated and lose interest in things I usually enjoy. I’m not sure why this happens, but I think it might be because when I was in fourth and fifth grade, I spent a lot of time alone at home and got used to it. I thought being lonely was normal at that time. Then, when quarantine ended and I went back to school, I was around more people, which felt comforting. Now, when I’m alone again, it’s hard for me to stay motivated because it feels lonely, quiet, nothing but boredom. Like how I used to feel, it's the worst feeling ever.</p>

    <p>Another reason I might be feeling this way is because a classmate of mine died by suicide in February. That day made me cry more than I had in a long time. I kept thinking, 'What if I end up like him?' or 'What if one of my friends does?' He was such a supportive person; everyone liked him because he was chill and funny. He was always there for his friends when they needed him, but he needed support too.</p>
